2. Click **"Policies"** tab
3. Click **"New Policy"**

---

### **Policy 1: Public Read Access**

```
Policy Name: Public read access
Allowed Operations: SELECT
Target Roles: public
USING expression: true
```

Click **"Save"**

---

### **Policy 2: Authenticated Upload**

```

Click **"Save"**

---

  WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true
)
```

Click **"Save"**

---

## ‚úÖ **VERIFY SETUP**

After creating buckets, verify they exist:

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase
2. You should see 3 buckets:
   - ‚úÖ `neighborhood-images` (Public)
   - ‚úÖ `building-images` (Public)
   - ‚úÖ `review-images` (Public)
3. Each should have 4 policies

---

## üß™ **TEST UPLOAD**

1. Login as admin: http://localhost:3000/login
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/neighborhoods
3. Click "Upload Cover" on any neighborhood
4. Select an image file
5. Should upload successfully!
6. Image should appear immediately

---

## üîß **Alternative: SQL Method**

If you prefer SQL, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Note: Storage buckets can't be created via SQL
-- You MUST use the Supabase Dashboard UI to create them
-- But you can set up policies via SQL after creating buckets

-- For neighborhood-images bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('neighborhood-images', 'neighborhood-images', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- For building-images bucket  
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('building-images', 'building-images', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- For review-images bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('review-images', 'review-images', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Set policies for neighborhood-images
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'neighborhood-images');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated upload" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'neighborhood-images' AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'neighborhood-images' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true
  )
);

-- Repeat similar policies for building-images and review-images
```

## üìù **QUICK SUMMARY**

1. ‚úÖ Go to Supabase ‚Üí Storage
2. ‚úÖ Create 3 buckets (all PUBLIC):
   - `neighborhood-images`
   - `building-images`
   - `review-images`

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### **Still getting "Bucket not found"?**
- Make sure bucket names are EXACTLY: `neighborhood-images`, `building-images`, `review-images`
- Check they are marked as PUBLIC
- Refresh your browser

### **Upload works but image doesn't show?**
- Check bucket is PUBLIC
- Check "Public read access" policy exists
- Check file was actually uploaded (view in Storage)

### **Permission denied?**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check "Authenticated upload" policy exists
- Verify user is admin for admin uploads

**Create the buckets now and try uploading again!** ü™£‚ú®
