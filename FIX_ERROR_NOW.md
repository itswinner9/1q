## 🎯 What The New SQL Does

### Creates Better Structure:

**neighborhoods table** (unique locations):
```
- id
- name, city, province
- latitude, longitude
- total_reviews (count)
- average_rating (auto-calculated)
```

**neighborhood_reviews table** (all ratings):
```
- id
- neighborhood_id
- user_id
- safety, cleanliness, etc. (ratings)
- comment (text, optional)
- images (photos)
```

**Same for buildings!**

## 💡 How It Works After SQL

### Example: 2 Users Rate "Liberty Village"

**User A:**
```
Rates: 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 4 (avg 4.67)
Comment: "Love it here! Great community."
Photos: 2 uploaded
```

**User B:**
```
Rates: 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3 (avg 3.67)
Comment: "Pretty good but noisy"
Photos: 1 uploaded
```

**Card Shows:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ [User A's photo]        │
│ 🟢 User Photo  👥 2 Reviews│
├─────────────────────────┤
│ Liberty Village   ⭐ 4.17│
│ Toronto, Ontario        │
└─────────────────────────┘

Average: (4.67 + 3.67) / 2 = 4.17
Reviews: 2
Photos: 3 total
Comments: 2
```
