## 🎯 How It Works

### When User Submits Rating:

**Step 1: Check if location exists**
```javascript
Search for: "Liberty Village, Toronto, Ontario"
Found? → Use that location ID
Not found? → Create new location
```

**Step 2: Check if user already reviewed**
```javascript
Has this user reviewed this place before?
YES → Update their existing review
NO → Create new review
```

**Step 3: Auto-calculate (trigger)**
```sql
Trigger fires automatically:
- Counts all reviews for this location
- Calculates average rating from all reviews
- Updates location card
```

**Step 4: Display**
```
Card shows:
- Location name
- Average from ALL reviews
- Total review count (e.g., "5 Reviews")
- Photos from all reviews
```
