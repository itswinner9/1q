## ⚠️ YOU NEED TO: Set Up Storage (5 minutes)

### Why Images Weren't Showing:
The Supabase storage buckets don't exist yet or aren't public.

### Quick Fix:

**1. Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - https://app.supabase.com
   - Open your project: `tqxomrvaiaidblwdvonu`

**2. Click "Storage" in left sidebar**

**3. Create First Bucket:**
   - Click **"New bucket"**
   - Name: `neighborhood-images`
   - **✅ Check "Public bucket"** ← CRITICAL!
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

**4. Create Second Bucket:**
   - Click **"New bucket"** again
   - Name: `building-images`
   - **✅ Check "Public bucket"** ← CRITICAL!
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

**5. Done!** (Policies are optional for basic use)
