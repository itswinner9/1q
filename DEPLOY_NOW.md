# üöÄ DEPLOY NOW - Easiest Method (Vercel CLI)

## What is Vercel?
Vercel created Next.js, so it's the EASIEST way to deploy Next.js apps.
You can deploy from your terminal in 2 minutes!

---

## DEPLOYMENT IN 2 MINUTES

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```
This will open your browser - click "Continue with GitHub" or email

### Step 3: Deploy!
```bash
vercel
```

The CLI will ask:
- "Set up and deploy?" ‚Üí Press ENTER (yes)
- "Which scope?" ‚Üí Press ENTER (your account)
- "Link to existing project?" ‚Üí Press ENTER (no)
- "What's your project's name?" ‚Üí Type: neighborhoodrank
- "In which directory is your code located?" ‚Üí Press ENTER (current directory)

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables
```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
```
Paste: https://tqxomrvaiaidblwdvonu.supabase.co
Select: Production, Preview, Development

```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```
Paste: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InRxeG9tcnZhaWFpZGJsd2R2b251Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjAxOTM0MjIsImV4cCI6MjA3NTc2OTQyMn0.BS4Wp5lNSclPw5fxtfykI2l7HuAtPm4zzHqEyVmCXQc
Select: Production, Preview, Development

```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN
```
Paste: pk.eyJ1Ijoic2FhYW11c2UiLCJhIjoiY21nbW92aGhnMWsybDJvb2Vha3VudW1lNyJ9.WiiM88O6xOL_aA2y-4LYqw
Select: Production, Preview, Development

### Step 5: Deploy Again (With Env Vars)
```bash
vercel --prod
```

DONE! You'll get a URL like: https://neighborhoodrank.vercel.app

## Alternative: Netlify Drop (NO CLI NEEDED)

If you don't want to use CLI:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag your project folder onto the page
3. Wait for upload
4. Add environment variables in settings
5. Redeploy

---

## I Cannot Deploy For You Because:

- I don't have access to your Netlify/Vercel account
- I cannot log in to external services
- I cannot authorize deployments
- I'm an AI assistant, not a deployment service

BUT: The steps above are VERY easy and you can do them yourself!

The Vercel CLI method takes literally 2 minutes.

---

## Before Deploying - FIX LOCAL FIRST!

‚ö†Ô∏è Your local app has issues:
- Login stuck
- Profile loading
- Admin access blocked

FIX THESE FIRST:
1. Run CLEAN_DATABASE_SETUP.sql in Supabase
2. Restart dev server: npm run dev  
3. Test everything locally
4. THEN deploy

If you deploy broken code, it will be broken in production too!

---

RECOMMENDED: Fix local issues first, then use Vercel CLI to deploy.
