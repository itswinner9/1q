## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "No neighborhoods found"?

**Check 1: Did SQL run successfully?**
```
• Go to Supabase → Table Editor
• Do you see "neighborhoods" and "buildings" tables?
• Click them - do they have data?
```

**Check 2: Is .env.local correct?**
```bash
cat /Users/sakamuse/Documents/ratemy/.env.local

# Should show:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://tqxomrvaiaidblwdvonu.supabase.co
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
```

**Check 3: Check browser console**
```
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Press F12
3. Look for errors in red
4. Should see: "Fetched neighborhoods: 6"
```
