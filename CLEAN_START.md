# 🧹 Clean Start - Remove Fake Data

## Remove All Test Data

You have fake test data in your database. Let's remove it so ONLY real user ratings show!

## Step 1: Delete Fake Data

### In Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Click "SQL Editor"
3. Click "New query"
4. Copy this SQL:

```sql
-- Delete all test/fake data
DELETE FROM neighborhoods WHERE user_id IS NULL;
DELETE FROM buildings WHERE user_id IS NULL;

-- Also delete by name (just to be sure)
DELETE FROM neighborhoods WHERE name IN (
  'Liberty Village',
  'Downtown', 
  'The Annex',
  'Yorkville',
  'Yaletown',
  'Gastown'
);

DELETE FROM buildings WHERE name IN (
  'The Grand Tower',
  'Maple Leaf Apartments',
  'Lakeshore Condos',
  'City View Towers',
  'Vancouver Central',
  'Seaside Residences'
);
```

5. Click "Run"
6. Should see "Success" message

## Step 2: Verify Clean Database

### Check Table Editor:
```
1. Click "Table Editor" in Supabase
2. Click "neighborhoods" - should be empty or only have YOUR real ratings
3. Click "buildings" - should be empty or only have YOUR real ratings
```

## Step 3: Keep ONLY Real User Ratings

Now your database will ONLY show:
- ✅ king george hub (your real rating)
- ✅ tower 1 (your real rating)
- ✅ Any other ratings YOU submitted

NO MORE fake data like:
- ❌ Liberty Village (test)
- ❌ The Annex (test)
- ❌ The Grand Tower (test)
- etc.
