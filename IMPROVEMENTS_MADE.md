# NeighborhoodRank - Improvements Made ✅

## 🎯 Problems Fixed

### 1. **Autocomplete Design Issues**
**Problem:** Mapbox autocomplete was breaking the design and causing layout issues
**Solution:** Simplified to clean, native HTML inputs with proper styling

### 2. **Search Not Working**
**Problem:** Neighborhood search wasn't finding results, autocomplete was too restrictive
**Solution:** 
- Simple text-based search on homepage and explore
- Users can type anything and search
- No forced autocomplete selection required

### 3. **Complex Mapbox Integration**
**Problem:** Mapbox autocomplete was messy, causing conflicts
**Solution:** 
- Removed complex Mapbox geocoder from main search
- Kept only AddressAutocomplete as optional helper (not shown)
- Simple, fast, reliable search

### 4. **Form Input Issues**
**Problem:** Users couldn't manually type, forced to select from autocomplete
**Solution:**
- All form fields are now editable text inputs
- Users can type any neighborhood, city, or address
- No validation restrictions
- Freedom to enter any location
