## 📸 How Images Work Now

### Upload Flow:
```
User rates with photos
     ↓
Photos uploaded to Supabase Storage
     ↓
Public URLs generated
     ↓
URLs stored in database (images array)
     ↓
Database saves rating with image URLs
     ↓
Frontend fetches rating from database
     ↓
Images display from database URLs
     ↓
Visible to everyone!
```

### Database Schema:
```sql
neighborhoods table:
  images TEXT[]  ← Array of public URLs

Example:
images: [
  'https://tqxomrvaiaidblwdvonu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/neighborhood-images/neighborhoods/{userId}/image1.jpg',
  'https://tqxomrvaiaidblwdvonu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/neighborhood-images/neighborhoods/{userId}/image2.jpg'
]
```

### Display Logic:
```javascript
1. Fetch rating from database
2. Check if images array has data
3. If yes → Show user's photo from database URL
4. If no → Show beautiful default stock image
5. Always looks professional!
```

## 🧪 Test Complete Image System

### After Running SQL:

**Test 1: Upload Images**
```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Sign up/login
3. Click "Rate Now" → "Rate a Neighborhood"
4. Use Mapbox search (e.g., "King George Hub Surrey")
5. Click to auto-fill fields
6. Rate all categories
7. Upload 1-2 photos
8. Click "Submit Rating"
9. Check console (F12):
   - Look for "Uploaded image URLs: [...]"
   - Should see full Supabase URLs
```

**Test 2: View on Homepage**
```
1. Go to homepage
2. Scroll to "Top Rated Neighborhoods"
3. Find your rating
4. Should see:
   ✅ Your uploaded photo
   ✅ Green "User Photo" badge
   ✅ Beautiful display
```

**Test 3: Verify in Database**
```
1. Go to Supabase → Table Editor
2. Click "neighborhoods"
3. Find your rating row
4. Check "images" column:
   - Should see array: ["https://...jpg", "https://...jpg"]
   - These are the public URLs
```

**Test 4: Verify in Storage**
```
1. Go to Supabase → Storage
2. Click "neighborhood-images" bucket
3. Navigate to: neighborhoods/{your-user-id}/
4. Should see your uploaded files
5. Click file → Copy URL
6. Paste in browser → Image should load!
```

## 🔧 What Each Part Does

### Tables:
```sql
images TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}'
```
- Stores array of image URLs
- Empty array `{}` by default
- Fetched with rating data

### Storage Buckets:
```sql
public = true
file_size_limit = 5242880  (5MB)
allowed_mime_types = image types
```
- PUBLIC means anyone can view
- 5MB max per image
- Only image files allowed

### Storage Policies:
```sql
FOR SELECT TO public  (anyone can view)
FOR INSERT TO authenticated  (logged-in users can upload)
FOR UPDATE/DELETE TO authenticated  (users manage own files)
```

---

## ✅ Complete Workflow

### 1. User Uploads Photo:
```
Upload form → Supabase Storage → Public URL generated
```

### 2. Save to Database:
```
Insert rating with images: [
  'https://supabase.co/storage/.../image1.jpg'
]
```

### 3. Fetch and Display:
```
SELECT * FROM neighborhoods
     ↓
Get images array from database
     ↓
Display images[0] on card
     ↓
Show "User Photo" badge
```

### 4. Everyone Can See:
```
Public storage bucket
     ↓
Public image URLs
     ↓
No authentication needed to view
     ↓
Visible to all visitors!
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading?
```
1. Check Storage buckets exist
2. Verify buckets are PUBLIC
3. Check policies are set
4. Look at browser console for errors
```

### Images uploaded but not showing?
```
1. Check database - are URLs stored?
2. Copy URL from database
3. Paste in browser - does it load?
4. If 404 → Bucket not public
5. If 403 → Missing policies
```

### Console shows empty array?
```
console.log('Uploaded image URLs:', [])

This means:
- Storage upload failed
- Check bucket exists
- Check user is authenticated
- Check file size < 5MB
```
