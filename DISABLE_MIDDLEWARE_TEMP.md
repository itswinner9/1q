# ðŸ”§ Temporary: Disable Middleware for Admin Access

If middleware is still blocking admin access, you can temporarily disable it:

## Option 1: Comment Out Middleware (Quickest)

1. Open `middleware.ts`
2. Comment out the entire middleware function:

```typescript
export async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  // Temporarily disabled for debugging
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

3. Keep the config:
```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)',
  ],
}
```

## Option 2: Skip Admin Routes in Middleware

Add this at the very beginning of middleware:

```typescript
export async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname
  
  // Temporarily skip middleware for admin routes
  if (pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }
  
  // ... rest of middleware
}
```

## Option 3: Use Admin Layout Protection Instead

The admin layout (`app/admin/layout.tsx`) already checks admin status.
If middleware is disabled, the layout will still protect admin routes.

## After Disabling Middleware:

1. Restart your dev server
2. Try accessing `/admin` 
3. Should work if you're logged in and marked as admin in database

## To Re-enable Later:

Just uncomment the middleware code or remove the early return.

**Note:** This is for debugging only. In production, you want middleware enabled for security.
