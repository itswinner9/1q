1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project: `eehtzdpzbjsuendgwnwy`
3. Click **SQL Editor**
4. Open: `LIVRANK_COMPLETE_DB.sql`

---

### **STEP 2: Storage Buckets** (Already done?)

If you haven't already, create these buckets in Supabase Storage:

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase
2. Create 3 public buckets:
   - `neighborhood-images`
   - `building-images`
   - `review-images`

3. For each bucket, set these policies:
   - **SELECT**: Public (anyone can view)
   - **INSERT**: Authenticated users
   - **DELETE**: Admins + own files

---

### **STEP 3: Environment Variables**

Make sure your `.env.local` has:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://eehtzdpzbjsuendgwnwy.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your-mapbox-token-here
```

---

### **STEP 4: Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

This includes:
- ✅ `next-sitemap` (for SEO sitemaps)
- ✅ All existing dependencies

---

### **STEP 5: Test Locally**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open: http://localhost:3001

**Test these:**
1. ✅ Login/Signup works
2. ✅ Logo shows "LivRank"
3. ✅ Can rate neighborhoods/buildings
4. ✅ Building pages work (check existing buildings)
5. ✅ Neighborhood pages work
6. ✅ Admin panel works (for admins)

---

### **STEP 6: Generate Sitemap** (Before deployment)

```bash
npm run build
npm run sitemap
```

This creates:
- `public/sitemap.xml`
- `public/robots.txt`

---

### **STEP 7: Deploy to Netlify**

```bash
npm run build
```

If successful, deploy:

1. Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `.next`
4. Add environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`

5. Deploy!

## 📋 TODO List (What's Next)

### Still Pending:
1. **Create `/app/landlords/[slug]/page.tsx`** - Landlord detail page with SEO
2. **Convert building/neighborhood pages to use slug** - Change from `/building/[id]` to `/building/[slug]`
3. **Add internal linking** - Link buildings → neighborhoods, buildings → landlords
4. **Add Open Graph images** - Create default OG image (`/public/og-image.png`)
5. **Ensure SSR** - Make sure main pages use server-side rendering
6. **Add discussion UI** - Create Reddit-style discussion component for pages
