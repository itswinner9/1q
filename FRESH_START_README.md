```sql
SELECT make_user_admin('your-email@example.com');
```

### Step 3: Add Sample Data (Optional)

Run the `SETUP_AND_FIX_EVERYTHING.sql` script to add sample data for testing.

### Step 4: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart

- Or open in **Incognito/Private mode**

## 🎯 What's Fixed

### ✅ Database
- All columns exist from the start
- `overall_rating` used consistently (not `average_rating`)
- INTEGER columns accept integer values
- Status filtering for approved reviews
- Proper triggers for auto-calculating ratings

### ✅ Rating Calculations
- Landlord `overall_rating` = average of 5 category ratings
- Only approved reviews counted
- Rounding to nearest 0.5
- Category ratings use individual averages

### ✅ Frontend
- All queries use `overall_rating` (not `average_rating`)
- Ratings rounded to integers for INTEGER columns
- Fast parallel fetching
- No fallback errors

### ✅ Admin Dashboard
- Fetches pending reviews correctly
- Approve/reject works directly with database
- Real-time updates

---

## 🧪 Test Everything

1. **Login** to your account
2. **Submit a review** (it will be pending)
3. **Go to `/admin/reviews`** and approve it
4. **Check the explore page** - it should appear
5. **Submit a landlord review** - ratings should calculate correctly
