  && neighborhood.images[0]

// Shows image or fallback

)}

## 📊 Database Fetching Improved

### What's Fetched

- average_rating
- images array
- created_at

// Buildings
- id, name, address, city, province
- all ratings (management, maintenance, etc.)
- average_rating
- images array
- created_at
```

### Sorting & Filtering
