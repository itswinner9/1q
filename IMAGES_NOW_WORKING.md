```
When users rate WITH photos:

Photos saved to Supabase Storage
   ↓
URLs stored in database
   ↓
Photos display on cards
   ↓
Green "User Photo" badge shows
```

**What You See:**
- Actual photo user uploaded

- Real images from your Supabase storage
- Authentic visual proof

#### 2. **Beautiful Default Images** (when no user photo)
```
When users rate WITHOUT photos:
   ↓
System uses professional stock image
   ↓
Image based on location name
   ↓
Consistent, beautiful appearance
```

**What You See:**
- Professional neighborhood/building photo
