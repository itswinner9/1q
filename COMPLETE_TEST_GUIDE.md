## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Can't login
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you signed up first
2. Check email/password are correct
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try in incognito mode

### Problem: Admin panel not showing
**Solution:**
1. User must be promoted to admin: `SELECT make_user_admin('email@example.com');`
2. User must LOGOUT and LOGIN again after being made admin
3. Check role in database: `SELECT email, role FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'email@example.com';`

### Problem: Can't submit rating
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Fill ALL required fields (all star ratings)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify address was selected from autocomplete

### Problem: Ratings not showing
**Solution:**
1. Check review status: `SELECT status FROM building_reviews;`
2. Only `approved` reviews show to normal users
3. Admins can see all reviews
4. Default status is `approved` so this should work automatically

### Problem: Can't see my review
**Solution:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Check if you were redirected to building page
3. Reviews might be at bottom of page - scroll down
4. Check database: `SELECT * FROM building_reviews WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';`
