## Files to Use

‚ùå **Ignore these** (too complex, caused problems):

‚úÖ **Use ONLY this**:
- **ULTIMATE_FIX.sql** ‚Üê This one!

## Quick Reference

**Make someone admin:**
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'email@example.com';
```

**Check admin users:**
```sql
SELECT email, is_admin FROM user_profiles WHERE is_admin = true;
```

**See pending reviews:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM neighborhood_reviews WHERE status = 'pending';
SELECT * FROM building_reviews WHERE status = 'pending';
```

**That's it! Just run ULTIMATE_FIX.sql and restart your server. Everything will work.** üéâ
